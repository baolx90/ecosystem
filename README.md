# Big data playground: Cluster with Hadoop, Hive, Spark, HBase, Sqoop via Docker-compose.

I wanted to have the ability to play around with various big data
applications as effortlessly as possible,
namely those found in Amazon EMR.
Ideally, that would be something that can be brought up and torn down
in one command. This is how this repository came to be!
